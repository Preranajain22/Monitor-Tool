# Monitor-Tool
The "Monitor-Tool" project is designed to assess and enhance users' proficiency in various subjects through interactive exercises. A key feature of this tool is the "Fill in the Blanks" (FIB) module, which presents users with sentences or paragraphs containing missing words that they must correctly identify. This approach aids in reinforcing knowledge and evaluating comprehension.

To quantify user performance, the project incorporates a scoring system known as "FIBScore." This system assigns points based on the accuracy and completeness of the user's responses in the FIB exercises. The FIBScore provides immediate feedback, allowing users to gauge their understanding and track their progress over time.

**MY Contribution:**

In this project, my primary responsibilities included:

1. **Development of the Fill in the Blanks (FIB) Module:** I designed and implemented the FIB feature, creating a dynamic interface where users can engage with content by filling in missing words. This involved parsing text to identify blanks, managing user inputs, and validating responses.

2. **Implementation of the FIBScore System:** I developed the scoring mechanism that evaluates user inputs in the FIB exercises. This system calculates scores based on predefined criteria, ensuring fair and consistent assessment of user performance.

My contributions were pivotal in creating an interactive and educational experience within the Monitor-Tool project, effectively combining user engagement with performance assessment.
